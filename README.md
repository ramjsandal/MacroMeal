# MacroMeal

## What is this project?
Using Java, this project gives you well reviewed recipes that match your nutritional goals.

## Why is this project helpful?
Problem:
Mainstream recipe websites, the ones will large catalogues of recipes and many reviews, do not have the ability to search for recipes by macronutrients (macros). The few websites that do allow you to do this are very small, 
with very few recipes, a small userbase, and a small sample size of reviews. So if you are looking for a good recipe and care about your macros, you can either manually check highly reviewed meals from big websites to
see if they fit your diet, or cook something from a macro-friendly website with few reviews and hope that it is good

Solution:
This application takes a csv of recipes from allrecipes.com and gives the user the ability to search through them according to macro constraints. It also sorts recipes by a "power score" for each meal in the data set,
which is based off of the number of reviews and the average rating, giving you easy access to highly and widely reviewed recipes that fit your macros.
